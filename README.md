Using REST APIs in Flutter.

Andrea Bizzoto https://lnkd.in/eck5Qjx is a great teacher. He focuses not only on the outcome but also on how to do things the best way. He pays a lot of attention to detail and the application architecture. I was able to learn a lot from him.

I could develop a simple but functional one-page cross-platform single page application which can run both in Android and IOS.

If you want to try using it, link to the Android APK here - https://lnkd.in/e7-tpAw
